import Foundation

/// A synchronous operation that produces a result. If the operation is successful, the result holds a value of type `SuccessType`.
/// Otherwise, the result holds a value of type `FailureType`.
///
/// This class is meant to be extended and not to be used as-is. It is up to the developer to supply the types and to update the
/// `result` property accordingly as the operation progresses in its execution.
///
/// When the operation is finished, it is typical to want to access the value of `result`. There are several ways to do so.
///
/// First, you can access the result in the operation's completion block:
///
///		let operation = SomeCustomOperation() { (op) in
///		  guard op.isCancelled == false,
///		    let result = op.result
///		    else {
///		      return
///		  }
///		  DispatchQueue.main.async {
///		    switch result {
///		    case .success(let successResult):
///		      // ... do something
///		    case .failure(let error):
///		      // ... do something
///		    }
///		  }
///		}
///
///	Another way to access the result is after the fact of an operation's synchronous execution:
///
///		let operation = SomeCustomOperation(completionBlock: nil)
///		operationQueue.addOperations([operation], waitUntilFinished: true)
///		guard let result = operation.result
///		  else {
///		    return
///		}
///		switch result {
///		case .success(let successResult):
///		  // ... do something
///		case .failure(let error):
///		  // ... do something
///		}
///
