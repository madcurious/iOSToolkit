/**
 Creates a chain of `MDOperation`s. Each link in the chain may be conditionally executed depending
 on the results of the previous operation.
 
 All operations in the chain share the chain's callback blocks except for the `successBlock`,
 which is provided by the individual operations in the chain. The chain itself is not meant to have a
 `successBlock` of its own. Instead, the last operation in the chain defines the success for the entire chain.
 
 There are two ways to create a chain:
    1. Call an initializer of this class and set the shared callback blocks yourself.
    2. Create an `MDOperation` which serves as the chain's head, then call that operation's `chain()` function.
       The chain takes the head's callback blocks (except for the `successBlock`) to be shared by the entire chain.
 
 Operations are chained on the fly, i.e., when the chain itself is executed and every operation in the link
 executes its own `successBlock`.
