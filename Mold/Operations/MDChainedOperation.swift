/**
 Creates a chain of `MDOperation`s. Each link in the chain may be conditionally executed depending
 on the results of the previous operation.
 
 There are two ways to create a chain:
    1. Call an initializer of this class and set the shared callback blocks yourself.
    2. Create an `MDOperation` which serves as the chain's head, then call that operation's `chain()` function.
 
 Operations in the chain can have their own callback blocks separate from the callback blocks of the chain itself.
 They will be executed sequentially:
    * The chain runs its `startBlock`.
    * The head operation runs its `startBlock`, `returnBlock`, 
 
 **IMPORTANT:** This class is not meant to be subclassed.
